# CGRA151-2022
Assignments completed for CGRA151 - Introduction to Computer Graphics and Games

Introduces necessary background, fundamental concepts, and basic algorithms of Computer Graphics, including human visual perception, representation of colour and images, representation of 2D and 3D spaces, manipulation, movement and drawing of 2D and 3D objects. Students will use an appropriate modern programming language to investigate many of the ideas presented in the lectured material. The course involves writing simple programs for graphics and games using Processing. Understanding, explaining and producing a range of fundamental computer graphics and game algorithms that including line drawing, polygon filling, z-buffer, collision detection and movement. Understanding and use of vector and matrix representations in homogenous co-ordinate systems, to perform geometric transformation in two and three dimensions to understand and describe 3D viewing and perpective projection. Understand and explain human interaction with computer systems via performance modelling. Describe the limitations and implications these hold on the representation and interactions in graphics and games. Explain fundamental properties of light, colour and human visual systems as well as other basic mechanics and how they relate to graphics and games.
